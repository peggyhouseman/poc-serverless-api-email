## Serverless framework
- Provides a nice cloud formation abstraction
- Has built in templates to get started easily
> serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path email-service
- Infrastructure as code for serverless services
- Contained in serverless.yml file
- To run locally
> serverless invoke local --function send
- To deploy
> sls deploy
- State of cloud formation is saved in s3.  Serverless framework auto creates s3 bucket and stored cloud formation state files.
- Deletion of resources in serverless.yml file does remove it from AWS
- Able to specify API-gateway key by adding "apiKeys" element and providing name of key to show in gui
- Endpoints that required API-gateway keys must be marked "private: true"
- If Api-Keys are auto generated by serverless, the resulting keys are outputted on the console
- To call Api-Gateway endpoints secured by keys, the key must be provided as the value in the "x-api-key" header

> npm install -g serverless
- Install python: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
- Ensure python in PATH variables
- Install pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ or https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/
